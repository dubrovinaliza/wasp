You have been given a code **linreg.py** using linear regression for a classification problem. The wine dataset which is used in the code is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. The description of this dataset:

Classes: 3
Samples per class: [59,71,48]
Samples total: 178
Dimensionality: 13
Features: real, positive

Keep in mind that the task of multiclass classification is being solved here.
You are ONLY required to change the train_model function in such a way that accuracy is improved. Do not use any python libraries, except numpy and pandas. This model has accuracy = 0.94. Write new code for new model, compare accuracy and draw conclusions.
